# Magical Creatures Game Tools

I had the idea to design a deck-building card game to play with my school age daughter. After writing the initial game design and building the cards, I created a deck using https://www.dextrous.com.au/ and printed it on cardstock. (Tip: https://www.amazon.com/Sunstar-Kadomaru-Corner-Cutter-S4765036/dp/B0076FJ7SS is a really good product).

A few lessons from the initial test play with my wife: Building a balanced card game is hard, and even when you think the rules are simple enough, they need to be simplified more :)

I put this project on the shelf for now, but maybe will pick up again. It was fun to build the pipeline to build the assets.
