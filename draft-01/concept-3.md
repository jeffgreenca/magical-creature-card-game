## Cards

Quest cards give the player a mission to accomplish and a reward when complete. Players may complete a Quest during the Action phase by demonstrating that they have satisfied the Quest criteria. Completed Quests are placed in front of the player. When a player completes the specified number of Quests, they win the game.

Event cards cause an event to happen. Event cards may require the player(s) to roll a die to see how they fare in the face of the event.

Treasure cards can be purchased with Tokens, or obtained as the result of Events or Quests. Treasure cards are necessary for completing Quests. Treasure cards may have special effects. Treasure cards are played in front of the player rather than held in the hand. Treasure cards are returned to the Treasure pile rather than the discard pile.

Resource cards can be traded for Tokens: 3 matching resources can be traded for 1 Token. There are four types of resources: Feather, Shell, Leaf, and special Starlight. Starlight can be matched with any of the other resources including itself to form a set of 3.

## Setup

Shuffle the Quest, Event, and Resource cards into a single deck. Deal 4 cards to each player. Turn the topmost card over to form the discard pile.

Shuffle the Treasure cards and place them aside.

## Play

1. Draw (1 card from deck or top of discard pile)
2. Market (Purchase Tokens with Resource cards, trade Resources, Treasure, Tokens with other players)
3. Action (Play Event cards, complete Quests)
4. Discard (1 card if more than 5 cards in hand)

# Card Design

## Resource Cards

There are 4: Feather, Shell, Leaf, and Starlight.

## Treasure Cards

Categories:
- Cute Animals
- Magical Objects
- Fairy Friends
- Whimsical Wonders

Treasure Cards may grant additional benefits, such as +1 to dice rolls, ability to trade different combinations of resources for Tokens, protection against adverse effects, or other benefits.

## Quest Cards

Quest cards specify conditions that must be met. When completing a Quest, the player may be awarded benefits such as drawing an extra card, getting an extra token, keeping one of their Treasure cards, etc.

Typically Quest cards require using Treasure cards to complete the quest and returning them to the Treasure pile, but additional conditions may be required as well.
